From the lush forests of the North Rim, hike along sinuous sandstone ribbons sculpted over millions of years. Explore the more arid terrain of the South Rim and witness the canyon’s shifting palette of red, orange, and gold. Then head to Havasu Canyon, a stunning oasis located just outside a remote section of the park, for a camping expedition. Hike through a red-rock labyrinth and feel the cool spray of waterfalls as they gush over travertine terraces. Swim in turquoise pools, delve into slot canyons, and sleep in tents beside a shaded creek. Explore the geological formations that make the Grand Canyon one of the most magnificent natural wonders of the world.",

It is currently being held in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016.[1][2] Spain are the two-time defending champions, having won the 2008 and 2012 editions.<br>
		For the first time, the European Championship final tournament is being contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996.[3] Under this new format, the finalists will contest a group stage consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout stage including three rounds and the final. Nineteen teams – the top two from each of the nine qualifying groups and the best third-placed team – joined France, who qualified automatically as hosts; a series of two-legged play-off ties between the remaining third-placed teams in November 2015 decided the last four spots at the final tournament.",
